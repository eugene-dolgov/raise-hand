To find how many cookies Savannah has left, we need to determine the fraction of cookies she didn't eat, which is $1 - \\\\frac{5}{6} = \\\\frac{1}{6}$ of her cookies. Therefore, to find out the result, we need to multiply 36 by $\\\\frac{1}{6}$, which equals 6. This represents the number of cookies she did not eat, and it's not the number of cookies she ate. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.\"}, {\"id\": \"B\", \"answer\": \"30 cookies\", \"correct\": false, \"explanation\": \"This answer is incorrect. When Savannah eats $\\\\frac{5}{6}$ of the cookies, she leaves $\\\\frac{1}{6}$ of the cookies uneaten. To determine how many cookies she has left, you need to multiply the total number of cookies, which is 36, by the fraction that represents the part she did not eat, which is $\\\\frac{1}{6}$. The multiplication gives us $(36 \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{6}) = 6$ cookies, but it's the number of cookies left, not the cookies eaten. So, this answer is incorrect.\"}, {\"id\": \"C\", \"answer\": \"5 cookies\", \"correct\": false, \"explanation\": \"This answer is incorrect. To figure out how many cookies Savannah has left, you need to subtract the amount she ate from the total. $\\\\frac{5}{6}$ of 36 is 30, so if you subtract 30 from 36, you get 6, which is the correct answer since that's how many cookies she has left. The number of cookies she has left is less than the original number, not the same or more. So, this answer is incorrect.\"}, {\"id\": \"D\", \"answer\": \"6 cookies\", \"correct\": true, \"explanation\": \"This is correct! Savannah eats $\\\\frac{5}{6}$ of the cookies, which means she left $\\\\frac{1}{6}$ of the cookies. To calculate the number of cookies she left, you need to multiply the total number of cookies by $\\\\frac{1}{6}$, which is the fraction that represents the part she did not eat. So, $36 \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{6} = 6$. That means Savannah has 6 cookies left.\"}]}"
